# Contributing

Do you want to contribute? We'd love that!

Our goal is to share useful projects with Arbitrum Stylus developers.

## How?

The easiest way is to go to https://github.com/OffchainLabs/awesome-stylus/blob/main/README.md and click on the "pen" icon in the upper right corner. Make the changes to the file and follow the instructions to create a pull request.

If you want to add an entry to the `README.md` please consider this:

- Is the entry valuable to people trying to get things done with Arbitrum Stylus?
- If you want to add something, please use the template `[ACCOUNT/REPO](https://github.com/ACCOUNT/REPO) - DESCRIPTION`
- If it's an implementation of an ERC spec and there are already existing examples of that spec, please add it to the subsection for that spec (or create one if it doesn't exist and move the other one to that)

## Removing Projects

- If an example is broken or missing, create an issue and we'll review.
